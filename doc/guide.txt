1. Copy the project.zip file into your Linux system and unzip it.
2. Change into the project directory
	cd project
3. Compile the project. And you will two executable files named "server" and "client"
	make
4. Run the server in your client with the specific port
	./server 8888
5. Open the new terminal, and change into our project directory and run the client. You must specify the server address and port.
	./client 127.0.0.1 8888
6. Run commands in the client terminal. You can type add/remove/query commands like the following commands
	a key1 value1
	a key2 value2
	a key3 value3
	q key1
	r key2

--------------------------------
	From the 1st line to the 3rd line will add three entries in the server database.
	The 4th line will query the entry whose key is "key1" and shows the result.
	The 5th line will remove the entry whose key is "key2".
---------------------------------

7. Run commands in the server terminal. You can run the following 3 commands.
	- "p": print all the db entries.
	- "s": stop all the connected clients. If you run this command, all the commands inputed from the client will not work.
	- "g": release all the stopped clients and let them go on. If you run this command, all the stopped clients will be restored and continues working.

8. You can run multiple instances of client in multiple terminal. Because our server and db module is designed to be multi-thread safe.
